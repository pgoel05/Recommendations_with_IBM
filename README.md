## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

With this project I have analyzed the interactions that users had with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code will easily run with the default anaconda packaged libraries. Still, I am mentioning the important modules below:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Maplotlib
- Pickle
